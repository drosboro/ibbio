## Mr. Dmitruk

* Walk to Tynehead (probably about 1:15-1:30)
    - reminder to socially distance while walking, but also to travel with a partner.
    - Your goal is to generate, with your partner, some potential ecology research questions.
        + Most good RQs start as "how does factor x affect factor y".
        + In Ecology, factor x is often _abiotic_, and factor y is often _biotic_ - e.g. "How does distance from open/standing water affect the number of mosquitoes present?"  "How does the amount of sunlight affect the ripening of blackberries?"
        + Sometimes "factor x" can also be _biotic_ - "How does the presence of heather in an area affect the growth of moss?"
        + Concentrate on factors that you think you could find a way to measure quantitatively.
        + As you walk with your partner, try to identify as many potential factors as you can.  Make a list.
        + See if you can generate at least a couple of reasonable research questions from your factors.
        + Post your research questions to the form on Google Classroom.  We'll discuss these on Monday.
* Remaining time
    - If you haven't already, read 4.1 in the textbook.
    - Pre-read 4.2.
    - Do the DBQs on pg 216 and pg 219 - we'll discuss these on Monday.
